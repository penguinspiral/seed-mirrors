# About

This 'mirrors' directory serves as the "root" path in which the 'seed-mirrors'
runtime stores local copies of configured upstream repositories listed under
'conf/debmirror'.


# Usage

This file serves as a necessary placeholder (for Git and Make) for the 'seed-mirrors'
_default_ runtime `MIRRORS_ROOT` variable.

The Debian GNU/Linux "Bullseye" AMD64 architecture upstream repository consumes
~90GiBs of disk space. The `make` variable, `MIRRORS_ROOT`, can be specified
during invocation to target a different "root" path for storing local mirrors.
